  <h1 class="heading">Who are we?</h1>

  <p class="about">
    From the very beginning, Tesla has been guided by its core principles, to
    accelerate and improve upon the efficiency of an eco-sustainable mode of
    transport by bringing electric cars to market. At Tesla, we believe that
    this requires a willingness to innovate, and foster new ideas that bring us
    into the future.<br />Tesla was founded by the Musk brothers, who believed
    that when it came to climate change and driving, no one should have to
    compromise.<br />With our new lineup for 2021, the Æ, Ø, and Å models,
    we're paying tribute to our norwegian heritage. Our great grandfathers
    were from Norway, so we feel it's only right to name our new cars after
    the three special letters in the Norwegian alphabet. The new Tesla lineup
    for 2021 brings never before seen cutting edge technology to modern
    electric cars, at various price points.

      <p class="name">Håvard Musk</p>
      <span class="text">Meet Håvard, born in 1961, and the first born of the three Musk
        brothers. At an early age, he clearly showed an interest in technology
        and cars. When he was two, he already knew how to read and write.<br /><br />
        At seven, he knew three languages fluently, and was studying with the
        middle school students. He early showed his passion for music and was
        confirmed to have perfect pitch. As well as a successful entrepreneur,
        he’s also an excellent pianist.<br /><br />
        When he was 14, he began his studies at Harvard University, graduating
        from high school with the highest grades. After graduating from
        Harvard with a PhD in marketing, he decided to pursue his love for
        cars with his two brothers, Jeslin and Nikolai. In the year 2000, when
        he was 39, he founded Tesla Motors together with his brothers.<br /><br />
        Tesla turned out to be hugely successful and made Håvard and his
        brothers billionaires in the span of one year. As the head marketing
        specialist at Tesla, Håvard has contributed vastly to Tesla’s success.

      <p class="name">Jeslin Musk</p>
      <span class="text">Meet Jeslin, born in 1975, and the youngest of the Musk brothers. As
        with his brothers, he too showed signs of high intelligence at an
        early age.<br /><br />
        When he was 14, he got accepted into Mensa with a verified IQ of 165.
        The next year he started his studies in Mechanical engineering at the
        University of Toronto, finishing his PhD six years later. <br /><br />
        After finishing his PhD, he went straight into work at various
        companies. Four years later he teamed up with his brothers, and they
        decided together to establish the company Tesla, focusing on electric
        cars. Jeslin is now working as the head engineer at Tesla and has over
        10.000 employees working for him in various countries around the
        world.</span>

      <p class="name">Nikolai Musk</p>
      <span class="text">Meet Nikolai, born in 1966, and the second born of the Musk brothers.
        When he was about 3 years old, he demanded to be allowed to borrow
        every book at the local library. Though that wasn't an option, he took
        home a bunch of books that day.<br /><br />
        Just eleven years later, he was accepted at the university of Oxford,
        where he earned doctorates in mathematics and computer science. He
        founded Tesla along with his two aspiring siblings, and now also
        directs a scientific initiative for eco sustainable energy.<br /><br />
        At a 60 Minutes interview, when asked about if he was happy with his
        life and achievements, he said: "I think I would have more of a life
        as a burger flipper. Or, like, a cowboy, or something like that. But
        as it stands, even though I sit at a keyboard for most of my time, I
        really enjoy what I do. I have always wanted to help everyone since I
        was a kid, and I'm happy that I'm in a position where I can do exactly
        that.”</span>
